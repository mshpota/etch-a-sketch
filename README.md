# ETCH-A-SKETCH

This project is an assignment from The Odin Project curriculum ([https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/)).

While working on this project,

- I learned about CSS grid
  
- Improved Javascript skills: 
    - DOM manipulation 
    - Changing attributes 
    - Changing CSS styles 
    - Working with events and event listeners

*Note*: the project works as intended in Firefox v103.0.1 on Fedora Linux. However, when testing it in Chrome v104.0.5112.79, the grid resizing doesn't work.
